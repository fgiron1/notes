For example, imagine that we have three `async fn`: `learn_song`, `sing_song`, and `dance`:

```rust
async fn learn_song() -> Song { /* ... */ }
async fn sing_song(song: Song) { /* ... */ }
async fn dance() { /* ... */ }
```

One way to do learn, sing, and dance would be to block on each of these individually:

```rust
fn main() {
    let song = block_on(learn_song());
    block_on(sing_song(song));
    block_on(dance());
}
```

However, we're not giving the best performance possible this wayâ€”we're only ever doing one thing at once! Clearly we have to learn the song before we can sing it, but it's possible to dance at the same time as learning and singing the song. To do this, we can create two separate `async fn` which can be run concurrently:

```rust
async fn learn_and_sing() {
    // Wait until the song has been learned before singing it.
    // We use `.await` here rather than `block_on` to prevent blocking the
    // thread, which makes it possible to `dance` at the same time.
    let song = learn_song().await;
    sing_song(song).await;
}

async fn async_main() {
    let f1 = learn_and_sing();
    let f2 = dance();

    // `join!` is like `.await` but can wait for multiple futures concurrently.
    // If we're temporarily blocked in the `learn_and_sing` future, the `dance`
    // future will take over the current thread. If `dance` becomes blocked,
    // `learn_and_sing` can take back over. If both futures are blocked, then
    // `async_main` is blocked and will yield to the executor.
    futures::join!(f1, f2);
}

fn main() {
    block_on(async_main());
}
```
